A working-class girl who leaves her hometown of Montreuil-sur-mer to seek her 
fortune in Paris. {{Fantine}}’s innocent affair with a dapper student named 
Tholomyès leaves her pregnant and abandoned. Although she is frail, she makes 
a Herculean effort to feed herself and her daughter, {{Cosette}}. Even as she 
descends into prostitution, she never stops caring for {{Cosette}}. She represents 
the destruction that nineteenth-century French society cruelly wreaks on the 
less fortunate.
