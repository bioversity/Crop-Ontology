Member of Patron-Minette.  Patron-Minette is a Parisian crime ring so 
close-knit that its four members—{{Montparnasse}}, {{Babet}}, {{Claquesous}}, and 
{{Gueulemer}}—are described as four heads of the same violent beast. 
Patron-Minette controls all the crime in one section of Paris and assists in 
the Thénardiers’ ambush of {{Valjean}}.
