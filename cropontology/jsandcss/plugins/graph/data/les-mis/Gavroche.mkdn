The Thénardiers’ oldest son. {{Gavroche}} is kicked out of the house at an early 
age and becomes a Parisian street urchin. He is a happy-go-lucky child who 
enjoys the small pleasures of life and demonstrates unusual generosity toward 
those even less fortunate than he is. He is also fierce and brave, and plays a 
decisive role in the barricade even though he does not have a gun.
