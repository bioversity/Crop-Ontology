A police inspector who strictly believes in law and order and will stop at 
nothing to enforce Franceâ€™s harsh penal codes. {{Javert}} is incapable of 
compassion or pity, and performs his work with such passion that he takes on a 
nearly animal quality when he is on the chase. He nurses an especially strong 
desire to recapture {{Valjean}}, whose escapes and prosperity he sees as an affront 
to justice. Ultimately, {{Javert}} is unable to say with certainty that {{Valjean}} 
deserves to be punished. This ambiguity undermines the system of belief on 
which {{Javert}} bases his life and forces him to choose between hypocrisy and 
honor.
