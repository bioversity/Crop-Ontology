A cruel, wretched, money-obsessed man who first appears as {{Cosette}}’s keeper 
and tormentor. Thénardier extorts money from whomever he can, and he 
frequently serves as an informant to whoever will bid the highest. His schemes 
range from robbery to fraud to murder, and he has strong ties to the criminal 
underworld in Paris. Blinded by greed, Thénardier is incapable of loving other 
human beings and spends every minute in pursuit of money.
