{{Fantine}}’s daughter, who lives as {{Valjean}}’s adopted daughter after her 
mother dies. {{Cosette}} spends her childhood as a servant for the Thénardiers in 
Montfermeil, but even this awful experience does not make her hardened or 
cynical. Under the care of {{Valjean}} and the nuns of Petit-Picpus, {{Cosette}} 
ultimately blossoms into a beautiful, educated young woman. She finds 
fulfillment in her love for {{Marius}}. {{Cosette}} is innocent and docile, but her 
participation in {{Valjean}}’s many escapes from the law show that she also 
possesses intelligence and bravery.
