{{Marius}}’s ninety-year-old maternal grandfather. {{Gillenormand}} prevents {{Marius}} 
from seeing his father, Georges {{Pontmercy}}, because he fears that {{Pontmercy}} will 
corrupt {{Marius}}. A devout monarchist, {{Gillenormand}} rejects the French Revolution 
outright and also rejects {{Pontmercy}}’s Napoléonic beliefs. Although 
{{Gillenormand}}’s classist views sometimes offend {{Marius}}, he truly loves his 
grandson and ultimately does what is necessary to make {{Marius}} happy.
